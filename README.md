# Hodge.jl

Library for manipulation of simplicial complexes
and cochains defined over them.

The focus of this package is on the formalism of
**Discrete Exterior Calculus**
and its applications to statistical rankings
and extraction of topological features from simplicial triangulations.

## Installation
