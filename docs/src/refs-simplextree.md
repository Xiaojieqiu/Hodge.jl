# SimplexTree

This is an internal module
used for representing simplicial complexes.

The methods in here allow for low level manipulation
of the simplicial structure and may break the representation assumptions
made throughout the remainder of the code.
Only use these if you know what you are doing (and really need to do that).

```@autodocs
Modules = [Hodge.SimplexTrees]
Order   = [:module, :type, :function, :constant, :macro]
